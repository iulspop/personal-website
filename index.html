        Software has immense potential to augment our human capacities. I build software tools that evolve our abilities
        to learn, focus & master ourselves.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer and my interests are especially inspired by this quote from Laird Hamilton, legendary
        surfer: "Where man and machine come together and keep evolving there's really no limitations".
      </p>
      <p>
        To me it seems that as far as software that enhances fundamental cognitive abilities and skills, were at a very
        early stage. I suspect there's orders of magnitude potential progress to make if we approach problems such as
        enhancing learning, focus, thinking, writing and progammming ability from a first principles persective. This
        involves researching human cognition and developing software based on that knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides augmenting specific abilities, like learning, I believe software can enable self-mastery. You can view
        the concept of self-mastery as the ability to be congruent with and fully express one's value system. You can
        categorize the components which make up self-mastery as
        <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Designing-Mind-Principles-Psychitecture-ebook/dp/B08SLFTWDL/"
          >emotional, cognitive and behavioral</a
        >. Today, software is often designed to capture our attention and condition our behavior to benefit the
        interests of companies. It doesn't invite us to question what are values are, what actions reflect what we want
        long term, then help us embody those values. Instead software is finely-tuned to hijack our psychology into
        behaviour that adds up to desirable metrics for software companies. However, software can be designed to assist
        and train one's ability to live according to your values. It can you draw towards what you choose to want in
        life, not merely immediate rewards. Imagine how such software could benefit human flourishing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, enhanced abilities and self-mastery generates greater human flourishing in of itself, but that
        capacity can be then applied to
        <a href="https://80000hours.org/">solving the most pressing problems of our age</a>. There's nothing I wish more
        but to be of great service to humanity & civilization. The tools I wish to create are meant to snowball my
        capacity in that direction.

      <h2>Effortless Browser Extension</h2>
      <p>
        My first forray into such tools is a tool for enhancing focus. I developed the Effortless browser extension to
        make being intentional and focused when using the browser effortless. You can find it on the
        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/effortless-make-focus-you/pfkeilinhgpmadhklhbpabebpapmdein"
          >Chrome Webstore</a
        >
        & the source code on <a href="https://github.com/iulspop/effortless-browser-extension">Github</a> . It's still
        at an early stage, but I find it's on a promising path.
